> Consider the searching problem: 
Input: A sequence of n numbers A D ha1;a2;:::;ani and a value . 
Output: An index i such that  D AÅ’i or the special value NIL if  does not 
appear in A. 
Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the sequence, looking for . Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties. 
```
INSERTING-SORT(A, n)
  for i = 2 to n
    key = A[i];
    j = i - 1;
    while i > 0 and A[i] < key
      A[i + 1] = A[i];
      i = i - 1;
    A[i + 1] = key;
