> Consider the searching problem: 
Input: A sequence of n numbers A D ha1;a2;:::;ani and a value . 
Output: An index i such that  D AÅ’i or the special value NIL if  does notappear in A. 
Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the sequence, looking for . Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.

```
LINEAR-SEARCH(A, n, x)
  for i = 1 to n
    if A[i] == x
      return i
  return NIL
```

**loop invariant**: 

Before each iteration, subarray A[1:i - 1] don't have value x.

***

**initialization**:

The subarray A[i:i - 1] has no element when i = 1

**maintenance**:

Compare A[i] with x, if A[i] equals x, break loop.

**termination**:

When the i = n + 1 the loop termiate, and return NIL indicate A[i:n] dosen't have value x.
