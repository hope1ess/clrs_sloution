> Consider the searching problem: 
Input: A sequence of n numbers A D ha1;a2;:::;ani and a value . 
Output: An index i such that  D AÅ’i or the special value NIL if  does notappear in A. 
Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the sequence, looking for . Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.

```
LINEAR-SEARCH(A, n, x)
  for i = 1 to n
    if A[i] == x
      return i
  return NIL
