# 2.1-2
**loop invariant**: 

At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 2-3, the variable sum is the sum of the subarry A[1 : i - 1]
*** 

**initialization**:
subarray A[i : i - 1] has no element, so that the variable sum is 0.

**maintenance**:
the variable sum add A[i], so the variable sum is the sum of subarray A[1 : i], loop invariant holds before next interation.

**termination**:
the loop will break when variable i is n + 1, that indicate the variable sum is the sum of subarray[1 : i - 1], the subarray is full array, the algorightm is corretc.
