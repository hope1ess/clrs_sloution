> What loop invariant does this algorithm maintain?

Before each iteration, the subarray A[1 : i - 1] consist of i - 1 minest elements in original array.
***
> Why dose it need to run for only the first n - 1 elements, rahter than for all n elements?

In n - 1 case, the element n - 1 will compare the element n, and oredered them in correct position.
***
> Give the worst-case running time of selection sort in $\Theta$-notation. Is the best-case running time any better?

No, the algorithm will itera whole subarrya A[i : n].
